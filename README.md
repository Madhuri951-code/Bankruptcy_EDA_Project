# Bankruptcy_EDA_Project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Bankruptcy dataset to understand financial patterns and identify key factors associated with company bankruptcy. The analysis includes data cleaning, missing value treatment, outlier detection, feature distribution analysis, correlation study, and key insights extraction


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Bankruptcy Dataset

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Bankruptcy dataset to analyze financial indicators and identify patterns that influence company bankruptcy risk.
The goal of this analysis is to understand the structure of the dataset, clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and extract meaningful insights before building any predictive models.


Tasks Performed

Data loading and inspection

Checking dataset shape and data types

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Statistical summary of features

Univariate analysis (distribution of variables)

Bivariate analysis (feature vs target comparison)

Outlier detection using IQR method

Correlation analysis

Key business insights and observations


Key Insights

Identified important financial ratios linked to bankruptcy.

Observed class imbalance in the target variable.

Found highly correlated features that may impact modeling.

Detected skewed distributions in multiple financial indicators.

 Conclusion

EDA helps in understanding data behavior, identifying patterns, and preparing the dataset for further machine learning modeling. This project demonstrates systematic data exploration and insight generation from financial data.
